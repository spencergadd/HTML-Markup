				<h2>Article 1</h2>
				<p>
					Hiking is a common form of exercise. It's a great way
					to get in shape, increase heart health, and clean out your lungs,
					although medical consesus hasn't been reached regarding that last point.
					For some hiking is the purpose, but others might hike to:
					
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Take Pictures</li>
					<li>Bird/Animal Watch</li>
					<li>Practice Painting</li>
					<li>Travel/See New Places</li>

				</ul>
				<p>
					This past summer my wife and I travelled to Peru and spent 5 days hiking to 
					Maccu Picchu in the Andes. It was a magnificent trip, although we got Covid-19 
					in Peru and getting home was much more difficult than we anticipated.

				<h2>Article 2</h2>
				<p>
					There are ample places to hike in Utah. We are blessed with immediate access to 
					alpine terrain. But for my wife and I, we also like to travel and see new places.
					Because of this we have hiked in these places as well:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Nepal</li>
					<li>Italy</li>
					<li>
						United States
						<ul>
							<!--Start of nested list-->
							<li>Wyoming</li>
							<li>Hawaii</li>
							<li>California</li>
						</ul>
						<!--End of nested list-->
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					We hiked along the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, along the Meditteranean
					coast in Cinque Terre, Italy, through Yellowstone, the Sawtooths, and the
					Windrivers in Wyoming (and Idaho), and we tried to hike Mount Shasta, but
					it was too hot. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the exercise aspect of hiking, we also like to include: 
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Painting</dt>
					<dd>: My wife loves to paint.</dd>
					<dt>Rock Climbing</dt>
					<dd>: I grew up climbing and my wife loves to climb, but we don't do it more than 10x a year</dd>
					<dt>Yoga</dt>
					<dd>: Yoga in a grove of pines is just different</dd>
				</dl>

				<aside>
					<h3>Aside Information</h3>
					<p>
						Most of the hikes we do are local. We try to hike every Saturday in the Spring/Fall,
						once a month in the Winter, and whenever we can in the Summer, if it's not blazing hot.
